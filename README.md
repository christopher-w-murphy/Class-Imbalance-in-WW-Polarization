# Class-Imbalance-in-WW-Polarization
Treating the measurement of the same-sign W polarization fraction as a class imbalance problem

## Motivation
A couple of papers, [arXiv:1510.01691](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01691), and more recently [arXiv:1812.07591](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07591), have used deep learning to determine the polarization fraction, _W<sub>L</sub> W<sub>L</sub> / &Sigma;<sub>i, j</sub> W<sub>i</sub> W<sub>j</sub>_, in same-sign _WW_ scattering. 

In this reaction two protons (_p_) collide at the Large Hadron Collider and produce two jets (_j_), collimated sprays of hadronic particles, and two _W_ bosons with the same electric charge. This process is interesting as a probe of the unitarization (probability conservation) mechanism in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.

The polarization fraction is predicted to be small in the SM, ~5%. Thus there is an imbalance of events where both _W_'s are longitudinally polarized vs. when one or none is longitudinally polarized. This motivates trying to treat this as a class imbalance problem, something which neither of the above papers do.

## Setup
Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/christopher-w-murphy/Class-Imbalance-in-WW-Polarization
```

## Requisites

- Anaconda Python 3
- Imbalanced Learn `conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn`
- Keras version 2.2 or higher `conda install -c conda-forge keras`
Imbalanced Learn is not fully compatible with Keras v2.0. I am not sure about v2.1.
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Jupyter Notebook

Optionally:
- pylhe `pip install pylhe` This is only used in preprocessing to extract the simulated data in lhe files and write them to csv. Since the csv files are included in the data folder there is no need to install this package to use the rest of the repo. Note that pylhe uses Python 2 not Python 3.

## Analysis
See the [notebook](https://github.com/christopher-w-murphy/Class-Imbalance-in-WW-Polarization/blob/master/notebook/comparison.ipynb) for full details.

### Comparison
First is a comparison between this work and arXiv:1812.07591, which establishes some baseline models. I am aiming to show that I can approximately reproduce the results of 1812.07591 given a different simulated dataset. Below are the predicted _LL_ fractions from this work.

### Different Metrics
Next the baseline models are evaluated using metrics that are better suited for class imbalance problems. For example, below are the precision-recall curves for these models

### Different Models
Lastly, different models, aimed specifically at class inbalance, are trained to see if there is an improvement in performance. These include:
- Class Weights
- Focal Loss
- Balanced Random Forest
- Balanced Batch Generator

Note: LaTeX equations are not properly visualized in Jupyter Notebook on Github. One option is to paste the link to the notebook into http://nbviewer.jupyter.org.
